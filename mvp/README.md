## **Overview**
This project consists of a `real-world-asset-v1` implementation in Pact. The real-world-asset-v1 standard references the ERC-3643 standards and is designed to provide maximum compatibility with them.

The main interfaces in this suite, inspired by the ERC-3643 standards, include:

- [**Real World Asset**](../contracts/real-world-asset/real-world-asset-v1.pact): Provides agent-managed transactions, such as pause, freeze users, forced-transfer, mint, burn.
- [**Agent Role**](../contracts/agent-role/agent-role-v1.pact): Defines and enforces roles for agents and owners.
- [**Identity Registry**](../contracts/identity-registry/identity-registry-v1.pact): Tracks and manages investor identities. Note: the implementation only uses registering and deleting identities.
- [**Compliance**](../contracts/compliance/compliance-v1.pact): Defines compliance standards to add rules in minting, burning, and transferring.

## [**MVP Token**](./mvp-token.pact)
The MVP implementation, provides 3 compliance contracts to showcase practical usage, including [`supply-limit-compliance-v1`](./compliances/supply-limit-compliance-v1.pact), [`max-balance-compliance-v1`](./compliances/max-balance-compliance-v1.pact), and [`max-investors-compliance-v1`](./compliances/max-investors-compliance-v1.pact).
For a complete function reference including internal methods, see [references.md](./references.md).

## Governance

The contract defines two types of owners:

1. **Governance (`GOV-KEYSET`)**:  
   - The primary owner responsible for **contract upgrades** and **initialization**.
   - Governed by the `GOV` capability, which enforces `GOV-KEYSET` keyset-reference-guard.

2. **Operational Owner (`owner-guard`)**:  
   - Registered during initialization and granted access to specific **operational functions**.
   - Can be updated by calling the function, `transfer-ownership`.
   - Operational Owner is enforced by `(only-agent "owner")` function, which is described in the **Agent Role** section.

## Initialization

## Agent Management
Token or identity management functions in the MVP token requires certain entities to sign the transactions.
Agents can be registered by calling `add-agent`, and can be removed by calling `remove-agent`.
Agents can be granted 3 roles, `agent-admin`, `freezer`, or `transfer-manager`. 

The enforcement of the roles are done through the following functions:

1. **`only-agent`**:  
   - Called with the agent's address and role.  
   - The agent address is retrieved from the data field `agent`, rather than the parameters.  
   - Ensures that the caller signs the managed capability, `(ONLY-AGENT "required-role")`, with a registered agent guard.
   - The role, `owner` can only be added at `init` or `transfer-ownership`, and can only be assigned to one address, and is retrieved directly from the table. 

3. **`only-owner-or-agent-admin`**:  
  - Ensures that caller signs one of `agent` with role, `agent-admin`, or the `owner`.

### `add-agent`

**Requirements**

- Agent must not already be active.
- Agent account must be a principal account
